# script-repo
Flask app that dynamically parses your scripts info and creates dynamic forms to run those scripts remotely

You'll need to use argparse to define your args and their helpers.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html

This is still a WIP, feel free to collaborate

My current TODO list is:


Figure a way to pass the argument type to the flask app and then create the form fields more dynamically to add better validation

Better argument parsing (the current version is terrible)

Dynamic api for the scripts

A front end that doesn't look so bad
